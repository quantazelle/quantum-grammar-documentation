# Basic Syntax

## Punctuation

### Case
Documents are written in ALL CAPS except for proper names (a living man or woman).
```
FOR THE COPY-RIGHT/COPY-CLAIM OF THE CLAIMANT IS BY THE :First-Middle: Last.
```
### Hyphens
Hyphens "-" connect two or more facts to make a compound fact. In the case of proper names, capitalization applies equally to both sides of the hyphen. [^hy-jm] 
```
FOR THE COPY-RIGHT/COPY-CLAIM OF THE CLAIMANT IS BY THE :First-Middle: Last.
```
[^hy-jm]: "The protocols of Correct-Sentence-Structure-Communication-Parse-Syntax-Grammar
dictate that what happens on this side of the hyphen must also happen on this side of the hyphen." :Jason-Matthew: Glass. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2iQWXbtdro

### Spacing
A [whitespace character](https://github.github.com/gfm/#whitespace-character) is a space (`U+0020`), tab (`U+0009`), newline (`U+000A`), line tabulation (`U+000B`), form feed (`U+000C`), or carriage return (`U+000D`).

If the colon comes before a word there’s a a space before the first letter of the word and the colon, it means “of the.” [^jm-co]

The code:
```
:CLAIM: FACTS IS: CONFIRMATION :CLAIMANT.
```
is equal to:
```
FOR THE CLAIM OF THE FACTS IS WITH THE CONFIRMATION BY THE CLAIMAINT.
```

More than one space or excessive line breaks are considered "breaks in the continuity of evidence" and cannot be parsed together as one statement. 

### Colons
A colon ":" that comes before a word and there is no space between the colon and the first letter of the word that it precedes represents “for the.”[^jm-co]

If the colon comes before a word there's a a space before the first letter of the word and the colon, it means “of the.” A colon at the end of a word followed by a space, and then a word means “of the.”

The code:
```
FOR THE CLAIM OF THE FACTS IS WITH THE CONFIRMATION BY THE CLAIMAINT.
```
is equal to:
```
:CLAIM: FACTS IS: CONFIRMATION :CLAIMANT.
```

### Tildes


### Brackets
Text within brackets "[]" is not part of the document. Text between them is considered as "boxing." [^br-d] They function as clarification or explanation for the reader provided in simplified English. 

```go
[This is a clarifying statement.]
```

### Parentheses
Text within parentheses () are not part of the document. They function as clarification or explanation for the reader provided in simplified English. 

```go
(This is a clarifying statement.)
```
### Italics
Italicised text is considered to be quoted text and is not part of the document.

### Quotation Marks
Text within quotes is a direct quote and therefore not part of the document.
```
[This is a clarifying statement. "I made this statement just now."]
```
