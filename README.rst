   deception and misunderstanding and speak only in facts
-  Present tense only
-  Parsed equally true when read forward or backward # Basic Syntax

Punctuation
-----------

Case
~~~~

Documents are written in ALL CAPS except for proper names (a living man
or woman).

::

   FOR THE COPY-RIGHT/COPY-CLAIM OF THE CLAIMANT IS BY THE :First-Middle: Last.

Hyphens
~~~~~~~

Hyphens “-” connect two or more facts to make a compound fact. In the
case of proper names, capitalization applies equally to both sides of
the hyphen.  [1]_

::

   FOR THE COPY-RIGHT/COPY-CLAIM OF THE CLAIMANT IS BY THE :First-Middle: Last.

Spacing
~~~~~~~

A `whitespace
character <https://github.github.com/gfm/#whitespace-character>`__ is a
space (``U+0020``), tab (``U+0009``), newline (``U+000A``), line
tabulation (``U+000B``), form feed (``U+000C``), or carriage return
(``U+000D``).

If the colon comes before a word there’s a a space before the first
letter of the word and the colon, it means “of the.”  [2]_

The code:

::

   :CLAIM: FACTS IS: CONFIRMATION :CLAIMANT.

is equal to:

::

   FOR THE CLAIM OF THE FACTS IS WITH THE CONFIRMATION BY THE CLAIMAINT.

More than one space or excessive line breaks are considered “breaks in
the continuity of evidence” and cannot be parsed together as one
statement.

Colons
~~~~~~

A colon “:” that comes before a word and there is no space between the
colon and the first letter of the word that it precedes represents “for
the.” [3]_

If the colon comes before a word there’s a a space before the first
letter of the word and the colon, it means “of the.” A colon at the end
of a word followed by a space, and then a word means “of the.”

The code:

::

   FOR THE CLAIM OF THE FACTS IS WITH THE CONFIRMATION BY THE CLAIMAINT.

is equal to:

::

   :CLAIM: FACTS IS: CONFIRMATION :CLAIMANT.

Tildes
~~~~~~

Brackets
~~~~~~~~

Text within brackets “[]” is not part of the document. Text between them
is considered as “boxing.”  [4]_ They function as clarification or
explanation for the reader provided in simplified English.

.. code:: go

   [This is a clarifying statement.]

Parentheses
~~~~~~~~~~~

Text within parentheses () are not part of the document. They function
as clarification or explanation for the reader provided in simplified
English.

.. code:: go

   (This is a clarifying statement.)

Italics
~~~~~~~

Italicised text is considered to be quoted text and is not part of the
document.

Quotation Marks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Text within quotes is a direct quote and therefore not part of the
document.

::

   [This is a clarifying statement. "I made this statement just now."]

   “The protocols of
   Correct-Sentence-Structure-Communication-Parse-Syntax-Grammar dictate
   that what happens on this side of the hyphen must also happen on this
   side of the hyphen.” :Jason-Matthew: Glass.
